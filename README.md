## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

I really took a mobile first approach in a different way this time with this challenge. Going truly and strictly mobile-first really helped me realize some things.

Also: how to point a pointed arrow from a div. That was neat.
